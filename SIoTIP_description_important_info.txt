development of a shared Cyber Physical System (CPS) infrastructure
Building automation

Availability and reliability of the shared platform offered to applications
is of paramount importance.

Our goal is to sell SIoTIP gateways and additional hardware devices,
such as sensors, enabling the deployment of a (shared) IoT infrastructure.
Furthermore, third-party developers can build applications on top of the
available infrastructure.
On the one hand, companies want to increase their business value
by automating or simplifying building management using IoT devices.
On the other hand, application providers want to be able to develop and sell
applications leveraging the available infrastructure to these companies.

Over time our platform will collect significant amounts of data:
raw data from sensors as well as application (usage) information.

In this model, sensors and actuators connect to a gateway,
and all gateways connect to the Online Service to synchronise data.
actuators | * ----- 1 | mote
sensors   | * ----- 1 | mote
mote      | * ----- 1 | gateway
Online service = system that comminuticates with gateways
storage/database ?

synchronisation activities are initiated by the gateway
the Online Service must also be able to push application commands

SIoTIP Online Service is an online system which collects data collected by the
sensors at each gateway, runs applications, manages gateway and application
configurations, and provides a web portal to which users can connect.
