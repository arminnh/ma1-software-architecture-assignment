Av1: communication between SIoTIP gateway and Online Service

Av2: application failure

Av3: pluggable device of mote failure
Use cases: 14, 48
Components for:
    prevention:
        *) Maybe ???: ApplicationPreferences -> set amount of sensors/actuators
    detection:
        *) timers for heartbeats (failure detection)
    resolution:
        *) applications need to deactivate automatically when
           there is no more hardware available
        *) notifications to infrastructure owner, customer organisation, application
Tactics:
    Detection:
        Ping/Echo
        Monitor
        Heartbeat
        Timestamp
    Resolution:
        notifications to 3 stakeholders
        degradation/removal from service -> turn off apps

P1: large number of users

P2: requests to the pluggable data database
Use cases: 11
Components for:
    *) processing incoming requests differently depending on system load and data priority
    *) detect normal or overload mode using response measure dealines
    *) pluggable data has no impact on other data
    *) starvation prevention
Tactics:
    Limit event response? reply within response measure deadlines
    Prioritize events
    Reduce overhead / Increase resource efficiency
    Introduce concurrency
    Schedule resources



M1: integrate new sensor or actuator manufacturer
Use cases: 8, 9, 10
Components for:
    *) data transmitting
    *) data processing
    *) data storage
    *) other functionality: data is available to applications
    *) initialisation, configuration, viewing data of available pluggable devices

M2: big data analytics on pluggable data and/or application usage data

U1: application updates

U2: easy installation
Use cases: 4, 6, 9, 17, 19
Components for:
    *) topology management
    *) detection (& registration) of pluggable devices
    *) automatic updating of topology
