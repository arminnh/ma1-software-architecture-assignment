\section{Decomposition 1: SIoTIP System (Av3, P2, UC11, UC14, UC15, UC18)}
\subsection{Module to decompose}
In this run we decompose the \texttt{SIoTIP System}.

\subsection{Selected architectural drivers}
The non-functional drivers for this decomposition are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Av3}: Pluggable device or mote failure
	\item \emph{P2}: Requests to the pluggable data database
\end{itemize}

The related functional drivers are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{UC11}: Send pluggable device data
	\item \emph{UC14}: Send heartbeat
	\item \emph{UC15}: Send notification
	\item \emph{UC18}: Check and deactivate applications
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Rationale}
We chose Av3 first since it had high priority and it was about the connectivity
of sensors in the system more so than M1 and U2. We
chose P2 along with Av3 as it was related to Av3 and would force us to think
about the way sensor data, the core of the whole system, is handled.
Handling Av3 and P2 would give a better starting point than M1 and U2
for the whole system for later ADD iterations.

\subsection{Architectural design}
\paragraph{Topic}
Discussion of the solution selected for (a part of) one of the architectural
drivers.

\subsubsection*{Alternatives considered}
\paragraph{Alternatives for solution}
A discussion of the alternative solutions and why that were not selected.

\subsection{Instantiation and allocation of functionality}
\paragraph{Decomposition}
Main aspects of the resulting decomposition.

\subparagraph{ModuleB}
Per introduced component a paragraph describing its responsibilities.

\subparagraph{ModuleC}
Per introduced component a paragraph describing its responsibilities.

\paragraph{Behaviour}

far.

\subsection{Interfaces for child modules}
\subsubsection*{ModuleB}
\begin{itemize}
	\item InterfaceA
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{returnType operation1(ParamType param1)} throws TypeOfException
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Effect: Describe the effect of calling this operation.
			\item Exceptions:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item TypeOfException: Describe when this exception is thrown.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

		\item \texttt{returnType operation2()}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Effect: Describe the effect of calling this operation.
			\item Exceptions: None
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data type definitions}
Describe per complex data type used in the interfaces what it represents.

\paragraph{returnType} This data element represents X.

\paragraph{ParamType} This data element represents Y.

\subsection{Verify and refine}
This section describes per component which (parts of) the remaining
requirements it is responsible for.

\paragraph{ModuleB}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Z1}: name
	\item \emph{UCd}: name
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{ModuleC}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{UCba}: name\\Description which part of the original use case is
	the responsibility of this component.
\end{itemize}
