\section{Decomposition 2: OtherFunctionality (M1, P2, UC11)}

\subsection{Module to decompose}
    In this run we decompose OtherFunctionality.


\subsection{Selected architectural drivers}
    The non-functional drivers for this decomposition are:
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item \emph{M1}: Integrate new sensor or actuator manufacturer
        \item \emph{P2}: Requests to the pluggable data database
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent The related functional drivers are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{UC11}: Send pluggable device data (P2) \\
              This use case stores pluggable device data in the pluggable device data storage.
              This could be a sensor reading, or an actuator status.
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Rationale}
    We choose M1 because it belogs to the quality attributes with hight priority. M1 is about
    integration of new sensor or actuator. And it is very important to easily add new devices, because market grows very fast
    and new applications are developing. So we want to focus on this quality attribute
    in the early stages and then based on that create other functionality and components.
    And we also choose P2 because it is related to M1. M1 required minimal changes to data processing and storage,
    so we have to deal with good solution for this topic.  
        
     %Why we do dis???? One was high priority and P2 is related. THey are family and family belongs together.


\subsection{Architectural design}
    % Tactics:
    %     Limit event response? reply within response measure deadlines
    %     Prioritize events
    %     Introduce concurrency
    %     Schedule resources

    \paragraph{Handling new types of pluggable devices for M1}
        The developers have to make changes to: component1, component2, datatype X.
        The new type of sensor needs to be able to be initialised so that it can send data.
        Thus, the PluggableDeviceFacade code that initialises devices should be updated for
        each new type of sensor. The PluggableDeviceData datatype should be updated to
        represent the new type of data. In this case, the new type will have to be added
        to the database that contains all different types of sensor data.

    \paragraph{Data conversions for M1}
        \texttt{The PluggableDeviceDataConverter} is resposible for converting data 
         in system, for instance converting temperature in degrees Fahrenheit 
         to degrees Celsius. System has to work with relevant data, 
         otherwise problem may arise. 
         

    \paragraph{Usage of new data by applications for M1}
        This is possible through the RequestData interface provided by PluggableDeviceDataScheduler.
        The application manager can get device data from the PluggableDeviceDB and return this
        data to applications in the PluggableDeviceData datatype. This datatype can easily be
        updated for new types of pluggable devices.

    \paragraph{Configuration of new device by infrastructure owners for M1}
        Initialisation: IO triggers the initialise() function which has been
        updated for the new pluggable device -> OK\\
        Configure access rights: has absolutely fucking nothing to do with the
        new sensor type -> OK \\
        Consult and configure topology: same as configure access rights

    \paragraph{Scheduling for P2}
        dynamic priority scheduling \\
        tactics: schedule resource, prioritize events, also limit event response?\\
        starvation avoidance

    \paragraph{Pluggable data separation for P2}
        "pluggable data has no impact on other data"
        two databases

    \subsubsection{Alternatives considered}
        \paragraph{Alternatives for solution}
            A discussion of the alternative solutions and why that were not selected.


\subsection{Instantiation and allocation of functionality}
    \paragraph{Decomposition}
        Main aspects of the resulting decomposition.

            \label{fig:it1-cc_main}
        \end{figure}

    \subparagraph{PluggableDeviceDB}
        store data related to pluggable devices

    \subparagraph{PluggableDeviceDataScheduler}
        scheduling, detect overload mode, store data, forward data

    \subparagraph{PluggableDeviceDataConverter}
        M1: conversion of new type of data of new type of device

    % \paragraph{Behaviour}
        % A SEQUENCE DIAGRAM FOR UC11 WOULD BE ACTUALLY VERY USEFUL (shows how the gateway checks if devices are initialised)
        % REMOVE THIS PART BECAUSE MONEYKA IS LAAAAZZZZYYYYYY BAD STUDENT "IT IS NOT NECESSARY"

    \paragraph{Deployment}
        Rationale of the allocation of components to physical nodes.
