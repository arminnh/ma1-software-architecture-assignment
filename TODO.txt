NOTES: we have more interfaces in graph as in description
  (e.g. AppMgmt in ADD 2 - it is not describe because it is in ADD 1 - we should remove it from
  graph or add also description in to ADD 2, it is confusing.)


\section{Decomposition X: DRIVERS (Elements/Subsystem to decompose/expand)}
    Instead of "Element", we do elements or subsystems to decompose/expand.
    The elements/subsystems to decompose/expand are the result
    of the chosen architectural drivers.

\subsection{Selected architectural drivers}
    \paragraph{Rationale}
        We leave this out, since the rationale is pretty much always the
        same. Of the drivers that are left, we chose the drivers that
        have highest priority assigned to them. Within a class of priority
        we choose the ones that we believe are most important to the core of the
        sytem or that will have the biggest impact on end-users.
        If drivers are grouped, this is because they fulfill similar
        responsibilities or they will force us to think about the design
        of a subsystem as a whole (e.g. Decomposition 2).


\subsection{Verify and refine}
    \noindent We will not do this step. We chose to handle all chosen architectural
    drivers completely in every decomposition.

Update current decomposition with given interfaces for pluggable devices (= constraint)

QUESTIONS:

When can we register for final presentation

Each decomposition you choose an element. Is this supposed to be a component
(like OtherFunctionality) or can this be a collection of components/subsystems?

Interfaces: What's the point of exceptions here? Also, we added
            the reasons for adding each method, is this ok?

How to make interface names transparent?

DeviceData, but PluggableDeviceID, what's up with that?

Is this ok to handle part of U2: A connection to the internet is a constraint of the GatewayFacade.

How to model the mote's broadcast message to search for a gateway

DO SOMETHING WITH THIS, UC11/UC13
\item AppDeviceMgmt, last defined in section \ref{add1-interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{void configurePluggableDevice(int deviceID, Map<String, String> settings)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For: Use case 11 step 3.b
        \item Effect: Causes certain settings to be set on a pluggable
              device that the gateway is connected to.
        \item Created for:
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
