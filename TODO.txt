ADD2:
    CHECK IF WE NEED "INITIALISE" FUNCTIONS AND UPDATE DIAGRAMS
    CHECK IF WE NEED "configurePluggableDevice" FUNCTION NOW OR LATER

ASK: In use case 11 step 2: The  system  checks  whether  the  pluggable
     device has  been  initialised (cf. UC8: Initialise  a pluggable device)
     IS THIS IN THE SYSTEM OR IN GATEWAYS? CAN WE CHOOSE?
     We said we would do this in the PluggableDeviceManager


alternatives for:
    M1: Handling new types of pluggable devices: no idea or N/A  ::((((
    M1: Data conversions: no idea or N/A  ::((((
    M1: Usage of new data by applications: no idea or N/A  ::((((
    M1: Configuration of new device by infrastructure owners: no idea or N/A  ::((((
    P2: Scheduling: some other method to do scheduling?
    P2: Pluggable data separation: same database but some complex kind of scheduling?
