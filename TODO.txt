Rename PluggableDeviceDB -> DeviceDB
Rename Database:AppDataMgmt to AppMgmt

QUESTIONS:

Interfaces: What's the point of exceptions? Do we use them for alternative scenario's? Like "not found exception"

            We added the reasons for adding each method ("Created for"), is this ok?

How to make interface names transparent?

Is this ok to handle part of U2 for easy gateway installation? "A connection to the internet is a constraint of the GatewayFacade".

Where to create the actual db queries?

==========================================================================

FOR THE SECTION ON CHANGES WE DID TO THE ADD SYSTEM:

    \section{Decomposition X: DRIVERS (Elements/Subsystem to decompose/expand)}
        Instead of "Element", we do elements or subsystems to decompose/expand.
        The elements/subsystems to decompose/expand are the result
        of the chosen architectural drivers.

    \subsection{Selected architectural drivers}
        \paragraph{Rationale}
            We leave this out, since the rationale is pretty much always the
            same. Of the drivers that are left, we chose the drivers that
            have highest priority assigned to them. Within a class of priority
            we choose the ones that we believe are most important to the core of the
            sytem or that will have the biggest impact on end-users.
            If drivers are grouped, this is because they fulfill similar
            responsibilities or they will force us to think about the design
            of a subsystem as a whole (e.g. Decomposition 2).


    \subsection{Verify and refine}
        \noindent We will not do this step. We chose to handle all chosen architectural
        drivers completely in every decomposition.

How is hardware linked to Infrastructure owners? Check if this is handled in one of the use cases
1 gateway <-> 1 infrastructure owner
