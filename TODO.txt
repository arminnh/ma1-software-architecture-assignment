FOR PROJECT DEFENSE: best is 25/05 - 27/05,
                     24/05 armin exam and monika project deadline

AFTER DEADLINE, BEFORE PROJECT DEFENSE:
    create use case log to print

In decompositions 1, 2, and 3, check decisions important for deployment and add them in rationale

Find methods that change state but have missing parameters

Av1: Interfaces between brokers?
     => Broker is something else, fuck the book
Broker -> CommunicationHandler: handles communication by remote method invocation
                                still not message queue or pulish subscribe

Av2: up time?
Av2: up-time => passive replication

P1: for replication of components, do we need to add routing or can we just add this in the rationale?
    => complicated
P1: ??? => active replication + load balancing? how many new components to handle all of this?

Different notify methods to know the trigger and put in other data maybe. => If no time, put in discussion

In rationale somehwere:
    How is hardware linked to Infrastructure owners?
        => 1 device <-> 1 infrastructure owner
        => when an IO buys/orders hardware, then that hardware is linked to the IO after the order is completed.

    5. Scenarios:
        *) UC11: Sensor data being processed by the system
        *) UC19: Subscribing to an application
        *) UC12: Applications issuing actuation commands
        *) UC14, Av3, UC18: Sensors/actuators failing, causing
                            (i) deactivation of specic applications,
                            (ii) a redundant sensor/actuator to take over in the context of a single application.
        *) Av2 : Application crash
        *) U2, UC4: Plugging in a new pluggable device (sensor or actuator)
        *) Av1, UC15: Detection and handling of communication channel failure
