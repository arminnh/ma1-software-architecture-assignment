List of changes for our ADD method

==========================================================================

Update current decomposition with given interfaces for pluggable devices (= constraint)

==========================================================================

QUESTIONS:

In use case 11 step 2: The  system  checks  whether  the  pluggable
device has  been  initialised (cf. UC8: Initialise  a pluggable device)
IS THIS IN THE SYSTEM OR IN GATEWAYS? CAN WE CHOOSE?
We said we would do this in the PluggableDeviceManager

When can we register for final presentation

OtherFunctionality: do we need to add interfaces already?
                    -> No, can add in later iterations

Each decomposition you choose an element. Is this supposed to be a component
(like OtherFunctionality) or can this be a collection of components/subsystems?

Interfaces: What's the point of exceptions here? Also, we added
            the reasons for adding each method, is this ok?

==========================================================================

DO SOMETHING WITH THIS, UC11/UC13
\item AppDeviceMgmt, last defined in section \ref{add1-interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{void configurePluggableDevice(int deviceID, PluggableDeviceSettings settings)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For: Use case 11 step 3.b
        \item Effect: Causes certain settings to be set on a pluggable
              device that the gateway is connected to.
        \item Created for:
    \end{itemize}
