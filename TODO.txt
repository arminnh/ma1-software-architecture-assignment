    CHECK IF WE NEED "INITIALISE" FUNCTIONS AND UPDATE DIAGRAMS
    CHECK IF WE NEED "configurePluggableDevice" FUNCTION NOW OR LATER

ASK: In use case 11 step 2: The  system  checks  whether  the  pluggable
     device has  been  initialised (cf. UC8: Initialise  a pluggable device)
     IS THIS IN THE SYSTEM OR IN GATEWAYS? CAN WE CHOOSE?
     We said we would do this in the PluggableDeviceManager
