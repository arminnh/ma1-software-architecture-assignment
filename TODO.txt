    1. Architectural Decisions:
        *) Architectural decisions for each QAS
        *) Other decisions
        *) Discussion
    2. Client-server view (UML Component diagram):
        *) The context diagram of the client-server view
        *) The primary diagram
    3. Decomposition view (UML Component diagram)
        Gateway, PluggableDeviceDB, Application execution subsystem
    4. Deployment view (UML Deployment diagram):
        *) The context diagram of the deployment view
        *) The primary diagram
    5. Scenarios:
        *) UC11: Sensor data being processed by the system
        *) UC19: Subscribing to an application
        *) UC12: Applications issuing actuation commands
        *) UC14, Av3, UC18: Sensors/actuators failing, causing
                            (i) deactivation of specic applications,
                            (ii) a redundant sensor/actuator to take over in the context of a single application.
        *) Av2 : Application crash
        *) U2, UC4: Plugging in a new pluggable device (sensor or actuator)
        *) Av1, UC15: Detection and handling of communication channel failure
