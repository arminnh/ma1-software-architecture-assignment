\section{Decomposition 7: UC28, UC29 (Elements/Subsystem to decompose/expand)}
    At this point, all quality attributes have been handled. The remaining
    decompositions handle all of the use cases that are left. The order
    is based on the priority of the use cases.


\subsection{Selected architectural drivers}
    The functional drivers are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{UC28}: Log in \\
              Short description of the UC.
        \item \emph{UC29}: Log out \\
              Short description of the UC.
    \end{itemize}


\subsection{Architectural design}
    This section describes what needs to be done to satisfy the requirements for
    this decomposition and how involved problems/obstacles are solved.

    \paragraph{UC: Problem title}
        Short description of the problem.\\
        Solution for the problem.


\subsection{Instantiation and allocation of functionality}
    This section describes the new components (and their responsibilities)
    which instantiate our solutions described in the section above. \\
    Unless stated otherwise, responsibilities assigned in previous decompositions are unchanged.

    \subparagraph{Component}
        Short description of its responsibilities. (Relevant UC)


\subsection{Interfaces for child modules}
    This section lists new interfaces assigned to the components defined
    in the section above. Detailed information about each interface and
    its methods can be found under chapter \ref{ch:elements-datatype}. \\

    \subsubsection{Component}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Interface
        \end{itemize}

\subsection{Data type definitions}
    This section lists the new data types introduced during this decomposition.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item DateTime: Represents an instant in time, typically expressed as a date and time of day.
    \end{itemize}
