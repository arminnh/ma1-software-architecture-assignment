        \subsubsection*{Rationale}
            Sessions are used to check whether or not a user is currently logged in.
            On successful login, a new session is created and stored in the SessionDB with a unqiue sessionID which is
            returned to the front end. The client then sends this sessionID in future requests to represent that the user
            is logged in.
            A database is used for checking the sessions, so that replication can be done on components that handle front
            end requests. If the session was stored in files, this would add extra overhead to keep all replicaâ€™s that store
            session files consistent.
            It is easier to do this using a database.
            Also, a separate database is used to not
            add a lot of extra requests for sessions to another database.

\section{Discussion}
    \todoinline{
    	Use this section to discuss your architecture in retrospect.
    	For example, what are the strong points of your architecture?
    	What are the weak points? Is there anything you would have done otherwise with your current experience?
    	Are there any remarks about the architecture that you would give to your customers?
    	Etc.

    Nothing about application state -> maybe could force app developers to add a procedure to save application state so that we could save this and reload that state later.\\
    Very high coupling for ApplicationManager\\
    Something about Modifiability problems we didn't think about.\\
    Too much communication between gateways and online service\\
    DeviceManager should maybe be decomposed to show how device connectivity is being tracked and how application usage/requirement data is stored.
