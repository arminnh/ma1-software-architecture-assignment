\section{ReqX: Requirement Name}
    \todoinline{Use this section structure for each requirement}
    \subsection*{Key Decisions}
    \todoinline{
    	Briefly list your key architectural decisions.
    	Pay attention to the solutions that you employed (in your own terms or using tactics and/or patterns).}
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item decision 1
    	\item \ldots
    \end{itemize}
    \emph{Employed tactics and patterns:} \ldots

    \subsection*{Rationale}
    \todoinline{Describe the design choices related to \emph{ReqX} together with the rationale
    	of why these choices where made.}

    \subsection*{Considered Alternatives}
    \paragraph{Alternative(s) for choice 1} Explain what alternative(s) you
    considered for this design choice and why they where not selected.

    \subsection*{Deployment Decisions}
    \ldots

    \subsection*{Considered Deployment Alternatives}
    \ldots

\section{Other decisions}
    \todoinline{\emph{Optional} If you have made any other important architectural decisions that do not directly fit in the sections of the other qualities you can mention them here.

    Follow the same structure as above.}
    \subsection{Decision 1}
    \subsubsection*{KeyDecisions}
    \ldots
    \subsubsection*{Rationale}
    \ldots
    \subsubsection*{Considered Alternatives}

\section{Discussion}
    \todoinline{
    	Use this section to discuss your architecture in retrospect.
    	For example, what are the strong points of your architecture?
    	What are the weak points? Is there anything you would have done otherwise with your current experience?
    	Are there any remarks about the architecture that you would give to your customers?
    	Etc.

    Nothing about application state -> maybe could force app developers to add a procedure to save application state so that we could save this and reload that state later.
    Very high coupling for ApplicationManager
