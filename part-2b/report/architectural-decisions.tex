\section{Discussion}
    \todoinline{
    	Use this section to discuss your architecture in retrospect.
    	For example, what are the strong points of your architecture?
    	What are the weak points? Is there anything you would have done otherwise with your current experience?
    	Are there any remarks about the architecture that you would give to your customers?
    	Etc.

    Nothing about application state -> maybe could force app developers to add a procedure to save application state so that we could save this and reload that state later.\\
    Very high coupling for ApplicationManager\\
    Something about Modifiability problems we didn't think about.\\
    Too much communication between gateways and online service
