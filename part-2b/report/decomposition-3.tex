    \end{itemize}


\subsection{Architectural design}
    This section describes what needs to be done to satisfy the requirements for
    this decomposition and how involved problems/obstacles are solved.

    Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

    \paragraph{U2: Gateway installation}
        The gateway should not require any configuration, other than being connected
        to the local wired or WiFi network, after it is plugged into an electrical
        socket. An infrastructure owner should be able get the SIoTIP gateway
        up-and-running (connected) within 10 minutes given that the information
        (e.g. WiFi SSID and passphrase) is available to the person responsible for
        the installation. \\

        A connection to the internet is a constraint of the GatewayFacade.
        After the gateway is connected to the internet (we don't model this),
        it connects to the gateway (we don't model this?) and registers itself (we model this). \\
        When an infrastructure owner orders a gateway, that gateway is linked to the IO.
        Gateway was already in the DeviceDB, but it was not linked to anyone. It has a gatewayID => unique identifier gatewayID same like motes.

        Important info related to gateways: GatewayID (new class), infrastructureOwnerID, IPAddress, status (active/inactive), location (in topology table)
            GatewayInfo(int gatewayID, int manufacturerID, int productID, int infrastructureOwnerID, IPAddress ip, int status)

        gateway registers with online service:
            % GatewayFacade -> DeviceDB: interface DeviceMgmt: registerGateway(int gatewayID, IPAddress address)
            %     Effect: Sets a gateway's status to 'active' and updates its IP address
            %     \item Created for: U2 - gateway installation
            TODO: gateway is added in the infrastructure owners topology as 'unplaced'.
                  it will be visible to the infrastructure owner after the gateway connects and registers with the online service

            We cannot link the gateway to an exact location for the infrastructure owner, because he might be managing multiple buildings
            an IP addresses can be dynamic. If we let the IO choose for which building the gateway is, then this is bad for usability and
            he has to configure anyways. Also in that case he cannot buy spare gateways, unless he buys spare gateways for every gateway in the building


    \paragraph{U2: Mote installation}
        Installing a new mote should not require more configuration than adding it
        to the topology. Adding new motes, sensors or actuators should not involve
        more than just starting motes, and plugging devices into motes â€“ plug-and-play!
        Reintroducing a previously known mote, with the same pluggable devices attached to it,
        should not require any configuration. It is automatically re-added on
        its last known location on the topology. The attached pluggable devices
        are automatically initialised and configured with their last known
        configuration and access rights. \\
        Thing that need to happen automatically:
        *) mote should find the gateway (mote sends a broadcast message->ReceiveBroadcast) => this is done automatically? see remarks of the use case
        *) gateway should register the mote (DeviceManager update, store entry in DB)
        *) on reintroduction of motes: DeviceManager notices this, makes the gateway send a message to online service to reuse some old topology

        % UC4:
        %     Remark : The mote is pre-congured to connect to a specic gateway by
        %      the hardware manufacturer. This linking process is out of scope for
        %      this assignment. Likewise, the automatic assignment of an IPv6 address
        %      to the mote is out of scope.
        %
        %     if new mote:
        %         for step 2., we can use the heartbeat system. heartbeat is sent from mote to gateway,
        %         the DeviceManager in the gateway notices that this is from a new mote and starts
        %         the registerMote procedure
        %         FOR RATIONALE: The IPAddress of the mote can be parsed out of the 6lowpan header in the heartbeat messages
        %         ALTERNATIVE IS GatewayFacade: registerMote, but this is more work (battery power and implementation)
        %
        %         FOR RATIONALE: be careful with int moteID. when we register, we send MoteInfo to the DB, DB returns a DIFFERENT int moteID we use the other moteID in the rest of the system
        %         3. DeviceManager -> GatewayFacade:       interface DeviceMgmt:   int moteID addMote(MoteInfo mote, int gatewayID, IPAddress moteIPAddress)
        %         3. GatewayFacade -> DeviceDB:            interface DeviceMgmt:   int moteID addMote(MoteInfo mote, int gatewayID, IPAddress moteIPAddress)

        %         4. GatewayFacade -> NotificationHandler: interface Notify:       notify(int userID, string message)
        %

        %     It is automatically re-added on its last known location on the topology.

        %     The attached pluggable devices are automatically initialised and configured with their last known configurations and access rights.
        %         See UC6 - reintroduced device


    \paragraph{U2: Pluggable device installation}
        Adding new sensors or actuators should require no further customer
        actions besides plugging it into the mote. Configurable sensors and
        actuators should have a working default configuration.
        Pluggable devices added to an already known mote are automatically
        added in the right location on the topology.
        Making (initialised) sensors and actuators available to customer
        organisations and applications should not require more effort than
        configuring access rights (cf. UC9). \\
        *) After devices are plugged in: connect to mote, set up default configurations
        *) if the mote is already known, the device is added to the right location on the topology
        *) need something for configuration of access rights, can only happen for initialised devices

        *) for reactivating last configurations: just set status to active and don't change configuration field, it will still be the same as in the past
            alternative: current\_configuration and last\_configuration in DB
            alternative: store all configurations on Gateway -> but it has bad resources
            alternative: store all versions on DeviceDB -> but lots of useless data then = extra work for db

        *) Pluggable devices added to an already known mote are automatically added in "the right location" on the topology.
            what exactly is a location?
            => when a pluggable device is connected to a new mote, the pluggable device gets the location of the mote by default

        % UC6: insert a pluggable device into a mote
        %     mote is already installed
        %
        %     when device is plugged into a mote:
        %         2. The system receives a message from the mote, informing it of the new pluggable device. This
        %         message species the identier and type of the new pluggable device.
        %         => for registration, we can use the heartbeat system. heartbeat is sent from mote to gateway,
        %         the DeviceManager in the gateway notices that there is a new pluggable device
        %
        %         Status of new pluggable devices will be 'uninitialised' by default in the DB, and 'unplaced' in topology
        %         New pluggable devices get the location of the mote in the topology, but have status unplaced
        %
        %         DeviceManager -> GatewayFacade:   interface DeviceMgmt:   void addDevice(PluggableDeviceID id, PluggableDeviceType type, Map<string, string> defaultConfigurations, int moteID)
        %         GatewayFacade -> DeviceDB:        interface DeviceMgmt:   void addDevice(PluggableDeviceID id, PluggableDeviceType type, Map<string, string> defaultConfigurations, int moteID)
