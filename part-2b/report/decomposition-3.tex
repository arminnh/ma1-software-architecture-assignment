\subsection{Architectural design}
    This section describes what needs to be done to satisfy the requirements for
    this decomposition and how involved problems/obstacles are solved.

    Some dabatase tables text we wrote:
        pluggable_devices
        topology_pluggable_devices
        permissions_pluggable_devices

        topology
            gateways(id, floor, room_number, wall, status)
            motes(id, gateway_id, floor, room_number, status)
            pluggable_devices(id, mote_id, gateway_id, status, physical location)
            pluggable_devices_redundancies(deviceID1, deviceID2)

        access rights
            rights(id, origranisation_id, device_id, can_read, can_configure, can_send_actuation_command)

    \paragraph{U2: Gateway installation}
        The gateway should not require any configuration, other than being connected
        to the local wired or WiFi network, after it is plugged into an electrical
        socket. An infrastructure owner should be able get the SIoTIP gateway
        up-and-running (connected) within 10 minutes given that the information
        (e.g. WiFi SSID and passphrase) is available to the person responsible for
        the installation. \\
        TODO: ask \\
        We need something that registers the gateway automatically with the
        online service after bootup. A connection to the internet is a constraint
        of the GatewayFacade.


    \paragraph{U2: Mote installation}
        Installing a new mote should not require more configuration than adding it
        to the topology. Adding new motes, sensors or actuators should not involve
        more than just starting motes, and plugging devices into motes – plug-and-play! TODO: ask \\
        Reintroducing a previously known mote, with the same pluggable devices attached to it,
        should not require any configuration. It is automatically re-added on
        its last known location on the topology. The attached pluggable devices
        are automatically initialised and configured with their last known
        configuration and access rights. \\
        Thing that need to happen automatically:
        *) mote should find the gateway (mote sends a broadcast message->ReceiveBroadcast)
        *) gateway should register the mote (DeviceManager update, store entry in DB)
        *) on reintroduction of motes: DeviceManager notices this, makes the gateway send a message to online service to reuse some old topology

        UC4:
            Remark : The mote is pre-congured to connect to a specic gateway by
             the hardware manufacturer. This linking process is out of scope for
             this assignment. Likewise, the automatic assignment of an IPv6 address
             to the mote is out of scope.

            if new mote:
                for step 2., we can use the heartbeat system. heartbeat is sent from mote to gateway,
                the DeviceManager in the gateway notices that this is from a new mote and starts
                the registerMote procedure
                FOR RATIONALE: The IPAddress of the mote can be parsed out of the 6lowpan header in the heartbeat messages
                ALTERNATIVE IS GatewayFacade: registerMote, but this is more work (battery power and implementation)

                FOR RATIONALE: be careful with int moteID. when we register, we send MoteInfo to the DB, DB returns a DIFFERENT int moteID
                               we use the other moteID in the rest of the system
                % DONT NEED THIS ONE 2. MoteFacade -> GatewayFacade: registerMote(moteID, IPAddress moteIPAddress)
                % ALSO DONT NEED THIS ONE 3. GatewayFacade -> DeviceManager: registerMote(moteID, IPAddress moteIPAddress)
                % 3. DeviceManager -> GatewayFacade -> PluggableDeviceDataScheduler: int moteID addMote(moteID, gatewayID, IPAddress moteIPAddress)
                                                    %  PluggableDeviceDataScheduler -> PluggableDeviceDB: addMote(moteID, gatewayID, IPAddress moteIPAddress)
                                                %   -> TopologyManager: addMote(infrastructureOwnerID, gatewayID, moteID) // status = unplaced
                                                    %  TopologyManager -> PluggableDeviceDataScheduler -> PluggableDeviceDB: addMoteInTopology(infrastructureOwnerID, gatewayID, moteID)
                % 4. DeviceManager -> GatewayFacade -> NotificationHandler: notify(infrastructureOwnerID, message)

        if reintroduced mote:
            It is automatically re-added on its last known location on the topology.
                % 3. DeviceManager -> GatewayFacade -> PluggableDeviceDataScheduler: reactivateMote(moteID)
                % 3. DeviceManager -> GatewayFacade -> TopologyManager: reactivateMote(moteID) // status = placed? (TODO ASK?), location is still there from the past, it was not removed

            The attached pluggable devices are automatically initialised and configured with their last known configuration.
            The attached pluggable devices are automatically initialised and configured with their last known access rights.
                Already done by DeviceManager, it detects the devices, updates DB, and configures the devices
                % 3. DeviceManager -> GatewayFacade -> PluggableDeviceDataScheduler: reactivateDevice(deviceID)


    \paragraph{U2: Pluggable device installation}
        Adding new sensors or actuators should require no further customer
        actions besides plugging it into the mote. Configurable sensors and
        actuators should have a working default configuration.
        Pluggable devices added to an already known mote are automatically
        added in the right location on the topology.
        Making (initialised) sensors and actuators available to customer
        organisations and applications should not require more effort than
        configuring access rights (cf. UC9). \\
        *) After devices are plugged in: connect to mote, set up default configurations
        *) if the mote is already known, the device is added to the right location on the topology
        *) need something for configuration of access rights, can only happen for initialised devices

        *) for reactivating last configurations: just set status to active and don't change configuration field, it will still be the same as in the past
            alternative: current_configuration and last_configuration in DB
            alternative: store all configurations on Gateway -> but it has bad resources
            alternative: store all versions on PluggableDeviceDB -> but lots of useless data then = extra work for db

        *) Pluggable devices added to an already known mote are automatically added in "the right location" on the topology.
            what exactly is a location?
            => when a pluggable device is connected to a new mote, the pluggable device gets the location of the mote by default

        UC6: insert a pluggable device into a mote
            mote is already installed

            when device is plugged into a mote:
                2. The system receives a message from the mote, informing it of the new pluggable device. This
                message species the identier and type of the new pluggable device.
                => for registration, we can use the heartbeat system. heartbeat is sent from mote to gateway,
                the DeviceManager in the gateway notices that there is a new pluggable device

                Status of new pluggable devices will be 'uninitialised' by default in the DB, and 'unplaced' in topology
                New pluggable devices get the location of the mote in the topology, but have status unplaced

                % DONT NEED THIS mote -> DeviceManager: registerDevice(id, type) (registers device as uninitialised)
                % DeviceManager -> PluggableDeviceDatabase: addDevice(PluggableDeviceID id, PluggableDeviceType type, Map<String, String> defaultConfigurations)
                % DeviceManager -> TopologyManager: addDevice(PluggableDeviceID id, int moteID)
                % DeviceManager -> GatewayFacade: newPluggableDevice(PluggableDeviceID id, PluggableDeviceType type, Map<String, String> defaultConfigurations)

                % In these methods, if the device already exists and is plugged in in another mote, clear the data

            if the device is a known previously active device (ON THE SAME MOTE):
                % DONT NEED THIS mote -> DeviceManager: registerDevice(id, type)

                ∗ marks the pluggable device as ‘active’:
                    % DeviceManager -> PluggableDeviceDataScheduler: reactivateDevice(PluggableDeviceID id)

                ∗ updates the topology:
                    % DeviceManager -> TopologyManager: reactivateDevice(PluggableDeviceID id)

                ∗ configures the pluggable device with the last known access rights:
                    % DeviceManager -> AccessRightsManager: reactivate(deviceID)
                    RATIONALE: nothing needs to happen here, permission information will just not be used if the device is inactive
                               if the device is reactivated, the permissions are already there

                * configures the pluggable device with the last known configuration:
                    % DeviceManager -> PluggableDeviceDB: Map<String, String> getConfig(PluggableDeviceID id)
                    % DeviceManager -> PluggableDeviceFacade: setConfig(config)

                ∗ checks and activates applications which can now execute again:
                    RATIONALE: gateway sends id of IO instead of fetching customers of IO. the online service will do that extra work = less work for gateway.
                    % DeviceManager -> GatewayFacade -> ApplicationManager: checkApplicationsForActivation(int infrastructureOwnerID)

                * send notification
                    % DeviceManager -> NotificationHandler: reactivatedPluggableDevice

                7.c. AccessRightsManager -> ApplicationManager: checkPluggableDevices(custOrg)


    \paragraph{U2: Easy applications}
        Applications should work out of the box if the required sensors and
        actuators are available. Only when mandatory end-user roles must be
        assigned, additional explicit configuration actions are required
        from a customer organisation (cf. UC17, UC19). \\
        *) if there is a subsription and new hardware is plugged in: need something to check
           if some application can be activated now
        *) need something to assign user roles to users during UC19

            application needs to be activated because new subscription, changed topology, new version of application

\subsection{Instantiation and allocation of functionality}
    This section describes the new components which instantiate our solutions described
    in the section above and how components are deployed on physical nodes. \\
    Unless stated otherwise the responsibilities assigned in the first decomposition are unchanged.

        Figure \ref{fig:FIGURELABEL} shows the components resulting from the
        decomposition in this run.

\subsection{Interfaces for child modules}\label{add2-interfaces}
    This section describes the interfaces assigned to the components defined
    in the section above. Per interface, we list its methods by means of its
    syntax. The data types used in these interfaces are defined in the following section. \\

    Each method shows which (part of a) quality attribute or use case caused
    a need for the method. However, this does not mean that a method is
    only to be used to satisfy that quality  attribute or use case, it could
    be used for other causes not yet mentioned here.

    The interfaces and methods defined here are to be seen as an
    extension of the interfaces defined in previous sections, unless
    explicitly stated otherwise.
