    TODO: find a way to display the page horizontally with the image covering the whole page. \\

    The context diagram for the deployment view is displayed in figure \ref{fig:depl_context}. \\

    Components X, Y, Z are deployed on multiple nodes for bla bla bla.\\
    Components A and B communicate using the C protocol...

\section{Primary diagram}
    The primary diagram for the deployment view is displayed in figure \ref{fig:depl_primary}.

    TODO: add references to "architectural decisions" where we made some choices related to deployment of components. \\

    \todoinline{
    The primary deployment diagram itself.
    This discussion on the parts of the deployment diagram which are crucial for
    achieving certain non-functional requirements, and any alternative deployments that you considered, should be in the architectural decisions chapter.
