	Illustrate how your architecture fulfills the most important data flows. As a rule of thumb, focus on the scenario of the assignment. Describe the scenario in terms of architectural components using UML Sequence diagrams and further explain the most important interactions in text. Illustrating the scenarios serves as a quick validation of the completeness of
	your architecture. If you notice at this point that for some reason, certain functionality or qualities are not addressed sufficiently in your architecture, it suffices to
	document this, together with a rationale of why this is the case according to you. You do not have to further refine you architecture at this point.}
