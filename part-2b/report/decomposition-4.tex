\section{Decomposition 4: Av2, UC12, UC25, UC26, UC27 (application execution subsystem)}


\subsection*{Selected architectural drivers}
    The non-functional drivers for this decomposition are:
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item \emph{Av2}: Application failure
    \end{itemize}

    The related functional drivers are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{UC12}: Perform actuation command
        \item \emph{UC13}: Configure pluggable device
        \item \emph{UC25}: Access topology and available devices
        \item \emph{UC24}: Consult historical data
        \item \emph{UC26}: Send application command or message to external front-end
        \item \emph{UC27}: Receive application command or message from external front-end
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Rationale}
        At this point the remaining drivers were Av1, Av2, and P1,
        which all had medium priority. We chose decompositions 4, 5,
        and 6 based on the priorities of the use cases that are related to the quality attributes. \\
        The related use cases from now on are the ones that would use components
        that are going to be changed in the decomposition.


\subsection*{Architectural design}
    This section describes what needs to be done to satisfy the requirements for
    this decomposition and how involved problems/obstacles are solved. \\
    If you read this, you are cool!

    % Pattern: Container
    %     Define a container to provide the execution environment for a
    %     component that supports the necessary technical infrastructure
    %     to integrate components into application-specific usage scenarios,
    %     and on specific system platforms, without tightly coupling
    %     the components with the applications or platforms.
    %
    %     Use the container to initialize and provide the runtime context for the
    %     components it manages. Define operations that enable component
    %     objects to access their connections to ports of other components,
    %     as well as to access common middleware services such as persistence,
    %     event notification, transactions, replication, load balancing,
    %     and security.

    RATIONALE: ApplicationContainerManager and DeviceCommandConstructor need to be
    reconfigured ivm some used interfaces

    \paragraph{Av2: Detection of failures}
        The system is able to autonomously detect failures of its individual
        application execution components, failing applications, and failing application containers. \\
        Upon detection, a SIoTIP system administrator is notified. \\
        The failure of an internal application execution component is detected within 30 seconds.
        Detection of failed hardware or crashed software happens within 5 seconds.
        SIoTIP system administrators are notified within 1 minute.\\

        To detect failures, we made use of the \texttt{Container} pattern.
        The application execution subsystem is composed of:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{ApplicationContainer}
            \item \texttt{ApplicationContainerMonitor}
            \item \texttt{ApplicationContainerManager}
            \item \texttt{ApplicationExecutionSubsystemMonitor}
        \end{itemize}

        The \texttt{ApplicationContainer}s are deployed in groups on different nodes.

        \texttt{ApplicationContainer}: is a container/sandbox that has 1 running application instance
        \texttt{ApplicationContainerMonitor}: monitors the \texttt{ApplicationContainer} instances

        To detect failing applications, \texttt{ApplicationContainer} and \texttt{ApplicationContainerMonitor}
            ApplicationContainer -> ApplicationContainerMonitor: void applicationCrashed(id applicationInstanceID)

        To detect failling application containers, \texttt{ApplicationContainerMonitor}
            ApplicationContainerMonitor -> ApplicationContainer: Echo ping()
            -> we say container has crashed/failed when the following has no response:

        To detect failures of individual application execution components,
        This means that one of \texttt{ApplicationContainer}, \texttt{ApplicationContainerMonitor}, \texttt{ApplicationContainerManager} crashed.
        If the \texttt{ApplicationContainer} failed, then the \texttt{ApplicationContainerMonitor} would detect this.
        If one of the other two components failed, the \texttt{ApplicationExecutionSubsystemMonitor} is put in place to detect this.

        These components will be deployed on the Online Service and on gateways.
        Since gateways are weaker machines than the ones on the Online Service,
        the ApplicationContainer can be confgured differently for gateways.
        The ApplicationContainers will then have stricter limits on
        resources used of the node they are working on.
        DeviceCommandConstructor and ApplicationContainerManager interfaces need to begin
        re-routed depening on whether they are in a Gateway or on the Online Service.

        % Application executing on Online Service failed & Application executing on Gateway failed
        %     -> ApplicationInstance has failed AND ApplicationContainer is still ok
        %        so ApplicationContainer sends message "application instance X has crashed"
        %
        % Container of application instance crashed
        %     -> ApplicationContainer has failed
        %     -> ApplicationContainerMonitor notices this (no reply to pings maybe)
        %     -> ApplicationContainerMonitor sends a command to the ApplicationContainerManager to restart or ...
        %
        % One of the internal application execution components crashed
        %     Application execution subsystem = ApplicationContainer + ApplicationContainerMonitor + ApplicationContainerManager

    \paragraph{Av2: Resolution of application failures and application execution component failures}
        In case of application crash, the system autonomously restarts failed applications.
        If part of an application fails, the remaining parts remain operational,
        possibly in a degraded mode (graceful degradation). \\
        After 3 failed restarts the application is suspended, and the
        application developer and customer organisation are notified within 5 minutes.\\

        In case of failure of application execution components or an application
        container, a system administrator is notified. \\
        SIoTIP system administrators are notified within 1 minute.\\

        When an application instance fails, the ApplicationContainerMonitor detects this and
        sends a command to the ApplicationContainerManager to restart the application instance.
        The ApplicationContainerMonitor keeps track of how many times the
        application instance has been restarted after a failure. After 3 failed restarts, the monitor
        send a command to the ApplicationContainerManager to suspend the application instance and send
        a notification to the application developers of the application and to the
        affected customer organisaiton. Also, to achieve graceful degradation,
        the ApplicationContainerManager notifies other parts of the application instance
        of its suspension.

        If one of the components of the application execution subsystem fails,
        a SIoTIP system administrator is notified.

    \paragraph{Av2: Failures do not impact other applications or other functionality of the system}
        This does not affect other applications that are executing on the Online
        service or SIoTIP gateway. This does not affect the availability of
        other functionality of the system, such as the dashboards. \\
        Applications fail independently: they are executed within their own
        container to avoid application crashes to affect other applications.\\

        Each ApplicationContainer contains one application instance. If an application fails,
        then this will be handled by the application execution subsystem so this
        does not affect any other application or other functionality of the system.
        The ApplicationContainers are constructed such that failures of applications
        do not affect the containers. The ApplicationContainers are to be deployed
        on different nodes alone or grouped with other containers. Write something here.


    % \paragraph{Av2: Up-time of application execution subsystem}
    %     The subsystem for executing applications in the Online Service must
    %     have a guaranteed minimal up-time. The subsystem for executing
    %     applications in the Online Service must be available
    %     99\% of the time, measured per month. \\
    %     Solution for the problem.
    %
    %     containers can have replicas, for example every container has 3 replicas and
    %     when one crash  there has to be sometnig that find out that there are
    %     just 2 replicas now and it is needed to create new replica.
    %
    %     There is also needed component for load balancing.
