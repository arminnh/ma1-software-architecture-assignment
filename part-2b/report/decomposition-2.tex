\section{Decomposition 2: M1, P2, UC11 (OtherFunctionality1)}


\subsection{Selected architectural drivers}
    The non-functional drivers for this decomposition are:
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item \emph{M1}: Integrate new sensor or actuator manufacturer
        \item \emph{P2}: Requests to the pluggable data database
    \end{itemize}

    The related functional drivers are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{UC11}: Send pluggable device data (P2) \\
              This use case stores pluggable device data in the pluggable device data storage.
              This could be a sensor reading or an actuator status.
    \end{itemize}

    \paragraph{Rationale}
        We chose M1 as it was one of the remaining quality attributes with high priority.
        M1's focus on easily introducing new types of devices to the system is very important
        because of the fast growing market for IoT and development of applications for IoT.
        Thus, we want to handle this quality attribute before U2 (the other remaining
        attribute with high priority), as we presume that customer organisations
        are more interested in using new devices than the effort it takes for
        infrastructure owners to install the devices. \\
        We also chose P2 because it is strongly related to M1; the whole data flow from
        devices to storage/applications needs to exist before modifications can even be made.
        This combination of M1 and P2 would force us to handle processing and
        storage of data while making the involved components as simple as possible to modify.


\subsection{Architectural design}
    This section describes what needs to be done to satisfy the requirements for
    this decomposition and how involved problems/obstacles are solved.

    \paragraph{M1: Data conversion}
        With new types of devices, the pluggable data processing subsystem
        should be extended with relevant data conversions,
        e.g. converting temperature in degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius. \\
        The \texttt{DeviceDataConverter} is put in place to handle the
        task of converting pluggable device data to data of a different type in the system.
        This component can easily be modified for new types of data simply by
        adding a new conversion method for the new.

    \paragraph{M1: Usage of new data by applications}
        The available applications in the system can be updated to use any
        new pluggable devices. \\
        This is made possible by the RequestData
        interface provided by \texttt{DeviceDataScheduler}.
        Data of the new type of device can be requested in the same way
        as for older devices: by using the device's unique id.
        The application manager can get pluggable device data from the
        \texttt{PluggableDeviceDataDB} and return this data to applications in
        the DeviceData datatype. This datatype can easily be
        updated for new types of pluggable devices.

    \paragraph{P2: Scheduling}
        The pluggable data processing subsystem needs to be able to run in normal
        or overload mode, depending on whether or not the system can process
        requests within the deadlines given in the quality requirement. Also,
        a mechanism should be in place to avoid starvation of any type of request. \\
        The \texttt{DeviceDataScheduler} is used to deal with this problem.
        It is responsible for scheduling requests that wish to interact with
        the \texttt{PluggableDeviceDataDB}. In normal mode, the system processes
        incoming requests in a FIFO order. In overload mode, the requests are
        given a priority based on what the request is for and what the source
        of the request is. The requests are then not simply processed in an
        order based on their priorities, but an aging technique is to be used
        such that starvation will be avoided. Thus, in overload mode,
        requests are processed in an order based on a combination of the
        priorities of the requests and the age of the requests.

    \paragraph{P2: Pluggable data separation}
        The processing of (large amounts of) requests concerning pluggable
        data has no impact on requests concerning other data, e.g. available applications. \\
        In order to statisfy this constraint, all data directly related to
        pluggable data has been separated into the \texttt{PluggableDeviceDataDB}.
        All requests concerning pluggable data will be handled by this new
        component. \texttt{PluggableDeviceDataDB} will run on a node different
        from the node that the \texttt{Datbase} component runs on. This way
        requests concerning pluggable will have no impact on
        requests concerning other data.

    \paragraph{M1: Handling new types of pluggable devices}
        The new types of sensor or actuator data should be transmitted,
        processed and stored, and should be made available to applications.
        The infrastructure managers must be able to initialize the new type
        of pluggable device, configure access rights for these devices, and
        view detailed information about the new type of pluggable device. \\
        The components created thus far have been created with high cohesion in
        mind so that updating them for new devices would be relatively straightforward.
        In order for this constraint to be satisfied, changes have to be made to
        the following elements:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{PluggableDevice}: This component needs to be updated
                  so that the new type of device can be initialised and configured,
                  and thus so that the device's data can be sent to the system.
            \item \emph{DeviceData}: Depending on how this data type
                  is implemented, it might need an update in order for it
                  to represent possible new data types (for example
                  Temperature Filipcikova) and for the new data types to be
                  serialized.
            \item \emph{PluggableDeviceDataDB}: The database needs to be updated
                  so that information can be retrieved about the new types
                  of sensors and the new types of data. Data related to the
                  displaying of sensor data will also need to be updated.
            \item \emph{PluggableDeviceConverter}: see above.
        \end{itemize}
