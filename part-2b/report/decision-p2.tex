\section{P2: Requests to the pluggable data database}

    \subsection*{Key Decisions}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{PluggableDeviceDataDB} separates the requests concerning pluggable data
                  so that those requests have no impact on requests concerning other data.
        	\item \texttt{DeviceDataScheduler} handles all requests for the \texttt{PluggableDeviceDataDB},
                  recognizes when the data processing subsystem needs to run in normal or overload mode,
                  and prevents starvation of requests.
        \end{itemize}
    \emph{Employed tactics and patterns:} scheduling, dynamic priority scheduling, logical separation, physical separation

    \subsection*{Rationale}
        P2 required the pluggable data processing subsystem to be able to run in different
        modes, depending on whether or not certain request deadlines at met. Also,
        a mechanism should be in place to avoid starvation of any type of request.
        To handle this problem, the \texttt{PluggableDeviceDataScheduler} is
        introduced to the system.
        It is responsible for scheduling requests that wish to interact with
        the \texttt{PluggableDeviceDB}. In normal mode, the system processes
        incoming requests in a FIFO order. In overload mode, the requests are
        given a priority based on what the request is for and what the source
        of the request is. The requests are then not simply processed in an
        order based on their priorities, but an aging technique is to be used
        such that starvation will be avoided. Thus, in overload mode,
        requests are processed in an order based on a combination of the
        priorities of the requests and the age of the requests. \\

        Furthermore, P2 requires that the processing of (large amounts of) requests concerning pluggable
        data has no impact on requests concerning other data.
        In order to statisfy this constraint, all data directly related to
        pluggable device data has been separated into the \texttt{PluggableDeviceDB}.
        All requests concerning pluggable data will be handled by this new
        component. By doing this, requests concerning pluggable data will have no impact on
        requests concerning other data.

    \subsection*{Deployment Decisions}
        It is important that the \texttt{PluggableDeviceDB} is deployed on a separate node
        so that it does not impact any other database.
