\section{Decomposition 9: UC21 (Elements/Subsystem to decompose/expand)}


\subsection{Selected architectural drivers}
    The functional drivers are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{UC21}: Send invoice \\
              Short description of the UC.
    \end{itemize}


\subsection{Architectural design}
    This section describes what needs to be done to satisfy the requirements for
    this decomposition and how involved problems/obstacles are solved.

    \paragraph{UC: Problem title}
        Short description of the problem.\\
        Solution for the problem.


\subsection{Instantiation and allocation of functionality}
    This section lists the new components which instantiate our solutions
    described in the section above. For each component we note the quality
    attribute or use case that prompted us to create it. Descriptions about
    the components can be found under chapter \ref{ch:elements-datatypes}. \\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Component: (Relevant UC)
    \end{itemize}


\subsection{Interfaces for child modules}
    This section lists new interfaces assigned to the components defined
    in the section above. Detailed information about each interface and
    its methods can be found under chapter \ref{ch:elements-datatypes}. \\

    \subsubsection{Component}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Interface
        \end{itemize}

\subsection{Data type definitions}
    This section lists the new data types introduced during this decomposition.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item DateTime: Represents an instant in time, typically expressed as a date and time of day.
    \end{itemize}
