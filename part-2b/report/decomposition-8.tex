\section{Decomposition 8: UC22, UC23 (Elements/Subsystem to decompose/expand)}


\subsection{Selected architectural drivers}
    The functional drivers are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{UC22}: Upload an application  \\
            Short description of the UC.
        \item \emph{UC23}: Consult application statistics  \\
            Short description of the UC.
    \end{itemize}


\subsection{Architectural design}
    This section describes what needs to be done to satisfy the requirements for
    this decomposition and how involved problems/obstacles are solved.

    \paragraph{UC: Problem title}
        Short description of the problem.\\
        Solution for the problem.


\subsection{Instantiation and allocation of functionality}
    This section describes the new components (and their responsibilities)
    which instantiate our solutions described in the section above. \\
    Unless stated otherwise, responsibilities assigned in previous decompositions are unchanged.

    \subparagraph{Component}
        Short description of its responsibilities. (Relevant UC)


\subsection{Interfaces for child modules}
    This section lists new interfaces assigned to the components defined
    in the section above. Detailed information about each interface and
    its methods can be found under chapter \ref{ch:elements-datatype}. \\

    \subsubsection{Component}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Interface
        \end{itemize}

\subsection{Data type definitions}
    This section lists the new data types introduced during this decomposition.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item DateTime: Represents an instant in time, typically expressed as a date and time of day.
    \end{itemize}
