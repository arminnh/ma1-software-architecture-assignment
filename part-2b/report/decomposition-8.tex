\section{Decomposition 8: UC22, UC23 (Elements/Subsystem to decompose/expand)}


\subsection{Selected architectural drivers}
    The functional drivers are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{UC22}: Upload an application
        \item \emph{UC23}: Consult application statistics
    \end{itemize}

    UC22:
        1. The primary actor indicates that he/she wants to upload an application.

            TODO

        2. The system asks the primary actor if he/she wants to update an existing application.

            TODO

        3. The primary actor provides his/her choice.

            TODO

        4. If the primary actor indicated that he/she wants to update an existing application, the system composes an overview of applications uploaded by the primary actor (e.g., as a list or table), presents this, and requests the primary actor to indicate which application to update.

            TODO

        5. The primary actor chooses the application to be updated.

            TODO

        6. The system asks the primary actor if this is an update that should be automatically activated for existing subscriptions.

            TODO

        7. The primary actor provides his/her choice.

            TODO

        8. If the primary actor has indicated that existing subscriptions should be automatically updated, the system requests the versions (or range of versions) that should be automatically updated.

            TODO

        9. The primary actor provides the requested information.

            TODO

        10. The system asks the primary actor to upload the application code, a description for display to customer organisations, and meta-data (such as the version number and subscription price).

            TODO

        11. The primary actor uploads the requested information.

            TODO

        12. The system performs automated application checks.

            TODO

        13. If the checks were successful, the system sends a notification to the primary actor (Include: UC15 : Send notification).

            TODO

        14. The system makes the application available in the application store. In case of an updated application, it replaces the previous versions of the application.

            TODO

        15. In case of an updated application that should automatically be activated for existing subscrip- tions (cf. step 6), the system updates the existing subscriptions of the application to the new version (Include: UC17 : Activate an application).

            TODO


    UC23:
        1. The primary actor indicates that he/she wants to an overview of uploaded applications.

            TODO

        2. The system retrieves all applications uploaded by the primary actor, and information about the amount of subscribers for that application. It presents this overview to the primary actor.

            TODO

        3. The primary actor selects an application.

            TODO

        4. If the selected application is an approved application, the system presents detailed statistics including the amount of subscribers.

            TODO


\subsection{Instantiation and allocation of functionality}
    This section lists the new components which instantiate our solutions
    described in the section above. For each component we note the quality
    attribute or use case that prompted us to create it. Descriptions about
    the components can be found under chapter \ref{ch:elements-datatypes}. \\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Component: (Relevant UC)
    \end{itemize}


\subsection{Interfaces for child modules}
    This section lists new interfaces assigned to the components defined
    in the section above. Detailed information about each interface and
    its methods can be found under chapter \ref{ch:elements-datatypes}.

    \subsubsection{Component}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Interface
        \end{itemize}

\subsection{New data types}
    This section lists the new data types introduced during this decomposition.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item DateTime: Represents an instant in time, typically expressed as a date and time of day.
    \end{itemize}
