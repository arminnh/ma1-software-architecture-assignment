Q66:   [ 1]
Q66explanation: [
    Way too few attributes. A lot of domain elements are missing. Unclear and too few relationships.

    Could do with a couple more use cases.

Q68:   [ 4]
Q68explanation: [
    M2 and U2 should have been chosen better.

Q69:   [ 4]
Q69explanation: [
    The report is easy to read and navigate, but there are a couple of spelling errors. The diagrams are easy to read. The report is not longer than it needs to be. The terminology is consistent throughout the report.

Q70:   [
    We think this report would be a good starting point for part 2 of the project. All of the use cases would need to be written out in full and some mode use cases are definitely needed: for "Installing a mote" and "Plugging in a new sensor/actuator". The domain model is pretty useless, but as we are doing part 2 without one, that doesn't seem to be too much of a problem.
