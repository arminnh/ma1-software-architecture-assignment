Q46:   [ 2] explanation: [UC4,UC5]
Q47:   [ 1] explanation: [Instead of UC10, we would choose UC14: Transmit Data. This way, the group of use cases is a better representation of the core of the system.]
Q48:   [ 2] explanation: [E.g. UC14 is missing in the use case diagram. UC10 has different titles in the description and in the use case diagram.]
Q49:   [ 1] explanation: [UC11: Step 1 is not an interaction between the primary actor and the system. Gateway should be a secondary actor.]

Q55:   [ 1] explanation: [P2 is just functionality. M1 "to the system" instead of "to the topology".]
Q56:   [ 2] explanation: [Descriptions and stimuli are clear.]
Q57:   [ 0] explanation: [ ]
Q58:   [ 1] explanation: [Av1: "minimal applications" is unnecessary. Av2: It is unrealistic for the system administrator (should be infrastructure owner?) to always check the battery of all motes. The guarateed lifetimes are not responses from the system.]
Q59:   [ 2] explanation: [ii, iii]
Q60:   [ 0] explanation: [ ]
Q61:   [ 2] explanation: [ii]
Q62:   [ 0] explanation: [ ]
Q63:   [ 2] explanation: [code/functionality]
Q64:   [ 1] explanation: [Not under control of the system and doesn't make sense: A system administrator should respond to an possible rejection notification within 8 hours.]
Q65:   [ 1] explanation: [U2: Easy adding of applications, but nothing about error/debug information.]

Q66:   [ 4]
Q66explanation: [
    All elements we could think of while answering the questiong were in the domain model. The domain model should have more attributes and some more relationships could be useful.
]
Q67:   [ 3]
Q67explanation: [
    A couple of important use cases/actors (e.g. Send Heartbeat, Application actor) are missing and there are some inconsistensies.
]
Q68:   [ 3]
Q68explanation: [
    We believe that all of the chosen quality attributes were good, except for P2. The descriptions and stimuli are clear. Some responses and measures don't really make sense or should be clearer.
]
Q69:   [ 4]
Q69explanation: [
    The report is easy to navigate, but there are many spelling errors. The domain model diagrams are easy to read. The use case diagram is a bit unorganized. The report is not longer than it needs to be. The terminology is consistent throughout the report.
]
% Questions 70-71 are open questions.
Q70:   [
    We think this report would be a decent starting point for part 2 of the project. A couple of quality attributes need some more details. Some more use cases would need to be added and all of the use cases would need to be written out in full.

    Keep up the good work, love you.
