\section{Detailed use cases}

\subsection{\emph{UCXXX}: Send sensor data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Name:} Send sensor data
    \item \textbf{Primary actor:} Mote
    \item \textbf{Secondary actors:} Sensor, Gateway
    \item \textbf{Interested parties:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Customer organisation:} pays for an application that uses this sensor.
            \item \textit{Infrastructure owner:} needs the sensor data for an application they set up.
            \item \textit{End-users:} use the sensor data in an application.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Preconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The mote has received data from a sensor connected to it.
            \item The mote is connected to a gateway.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Postconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The gateway has received and processed the sensor data.
            \item The Online Service has received the data and can process it.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Main scenario:}
        \begin{enumerate}
           \item The mote sends the sensor data to the connected gateway.
           \item The gateway receives the data and if applicable, runs some application logic.
           \item The gateway collects data until a synchronisation point is reached.
                 At that point, the gateway sends the data to the Online Service.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Alternative scenarios:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item [3b.] The gateway determined that the data was important
                  (e.g. cause for alarm, notification, etc.) and sent the data
                  to the Online Service immediately instead of waiting for the
                  sycnhronisation point.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Remarks:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is essential that the synchronisation protocol works
                  correctly in the presence of non-reliable network communication
                  so that there is no loss of data.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\emph{UCXXX}: Review application}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Name:} Review application
    \item \textbf{Primary actor:} SIoTIP System Administrator
    \item \textbf{Secondary actor(s)}:
    \item \textbf{Interested parties:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textit{Application developers:} want to add their application to the system
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Preconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system administrator is authenticated.
            \item The application needs to be reviewed by a system administrator.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Postconditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The system adminstrator accepts or declines the application.
            \item The application developers have been notified of this event.
        \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Main scenario:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The system administrator navigates to the applications component on their
                  dashboard and selects the application that needs to be reviewed.
            \item The system administrator reviews the application's functionality and
                  log history, and the message history with the developers.
            \item The system administrator indicates he wants to accept the application.
            \item The system logs this event and makes the application available to
                  customer ogranisations.
            \item The system notifies the application developers.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Alternative scenarios:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item [3b.] The system administrator indicates he wants decline to the application
                  and is prompted by the system to fill in the reason for this. The
                  application will thus not become available to customer organisations.
            \item [3c.] The system administrator indicates he wants communicate
                  with the developers before making a decision. Afterwards, return to
                  step 2.
        \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Remarks:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item When an application first gets uploaded to the system, it needs to be
                  reviewed and accepted by a system administrator. This will prevent
                  the available apps to be flooded with apps of very poor quality
                  or apps that are copies of other apps.
            \item If at some point in the future, automated testing for an app fails,
                  the app will need to be reviewed again before it can be made
                  available again.
        \end{itemize}
