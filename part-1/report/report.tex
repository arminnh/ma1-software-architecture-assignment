\chapter{Domain analysis}\label{sec:domain}
\section{Domain models}
The domain model is shown in figure \ref{fig:domain_model}.

\section{Domain constraints}
In this section we provide additional domain constraints.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gateways can to only run light-weight programs that are not too
          demanding in resources.
    \item The SIoTIP Online Service must be almost permamently available and sensor
          data is never lost or inconsistent.
    \item Core running inside SIoTIP must be able to interact with
          external applications and systems.
    \item Relaying information to the motes by the gateway is done by GET and PUT
          requests.
\end{itemize}

\section{Glossary}
In this section, we provide a glossary of the most important terminology used
in this analysis.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Application}: An application in the system is a program that
    uses sensors for a specific goal (e.g. fire detection). Customer organisations
    can subsribe to applications.
    \item \textbf{Application providers}: Application providers develop, upload,
    and maintain applications for the SIoTIP system.
    \item \textbf{Customer organisations}: Organisations that want to subscribe
    to applications. These organisations can subscribe to or unsubscribe from
    applications and get an overview of the invoices for their subscriptions.
    \item \textbf{Dashboard}: A dashboard is a collection of information which is
    available to a user. There are different dashboard for different type of users.
    \item \textbf{End-user}: End-users are the users that interact with deployed
    applications. They can issue commands to the application via a plethora of
    devices. For all end-users, the use of applications should simplify or
    automate their daily tasks.
    \item \textbf{Gateway}: A device which is connected to the Online Service
    and that has access to sensors and actuators. It can run some application
    logic and transmit data between the Online Service and the sensors/actuators.
    \item \textbf{Infrastructure owner}: This is someone who owns building(s),
    gateways, motes, sensors, and actuators. Owners are responsible for buying,
    installing, and maintaining hardware and the topology of their infrastructure.
    Owners can allocate installed hardware to specific customer organisations.
    \item \textbf{Mote}: A device that can host sensors and actuators. It connects
    these to the network and is used for communication between sensors/actuators
    and a gateway.
    \item \textbf{Notification}: A message that contains information about some
    event that occured in the system. Notifications have some priority. This
    influences how some notifications will be handled compared to others.
    \item \textbf{Online Service}: The online back-end which provides those
    services that are expected to generate the main revenue. Those services
    include the selling of hardware required for IoT infrastructures, and a
    platform where application providers and potential buyers can meet for a low price.
    \item \textbf{Sensor data}: Data about some sensor reading(s). Sensor
    data has some priority. This influences how some data will be handled
    compared to other data.
    \item \textbf{System}: "The system" is used to refer to the collection
    of entities that will be used by the SIoTIP corporation to render services.
    This includes the Online Service, gateways, motes, applications, etc.
    \item \textbf{System administrator}: System administrators monitor and
    manage the entire platform. They can view information about performance,
    running applications and sensors, shut applications down. These users are
    notified if alarming events threaten the platform.
    \item \textbf{User}: Someone who can log in and use parts of the system.
    Possibilities are system administrators, infrastructure owners, customer
    organisations, application providers, end-users.
