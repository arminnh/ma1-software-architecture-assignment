Q46:   [ 2] explanation: [UC4,UC5]
Q47:   [ 1] explanation: [Instead of using UC10, we would choose UC14: Transmit Data, because then the group of use cases is a better representation of the core of the system.]
Q48:   [ 2] explanation: [E.g. UC14 is missing in the use case diagram. UC10 has different titles in the description and in the use case diagram.]
Q49:   [ 1] explanation: [UC11: Step 1 is not an interaction between the primary actor and the system. Gateway should be a secondary actor.]

Q55:   [ 1] explanation: [P2 is just functionality. M1 "to the system" instead of "to the topology".]
Q56:   [ 2] explanation: [Descriptions and stimulus are clear.]
Q57:   [ 0] explanation: [ ]
Q58:   [ 1] explanation: [Av1: It unecessary term minimal applications. Av2: It is unrealistic for the system administrator (should be infrastructure owner?) to always check the battery of all motes. The guarateed lifetimes are not responses from the system.]

Q60:   [ 0] explanation: [ ]
Q61:   [ 2] explanation: [ii]
Q62:   [ 0] explanation: [ ]
Q63:   [ 2] explanation: [code/functionality]
Q64:   [ 1] explanation: [Not under control of the system and doesn't make sense: A system administrator should respond to an possible rejection notification within 8 hours.]
Q65:   [ 1] explanation: [U2: Easy adding of applications, but nothing about error/debug information.]
